As a college undergrad, I am eager to learn in a working environment. 
While I highly value education, I believe that there is no adequate substitute
for experience. A career objective for me is to learn how programming and 
logical analysis applies in the real world. I've had various assignments in 
college about solving puzzle like assignments, but I'm eager to tackle the 
challenge of real world problems. I want to grow with my employer and challenge 
myself. I love to work hard.

I've always loved mobile development. The first time I tried making a mobile app, 
I gave up within the first 20 minutes. I found it extremely difficult, so I came 
back to the project a year later. I then gave up for a second time. I gave up on my 
app idea 4 times before I successfully built the app in a week during my freshman year
of college. I wanted to build the app for the longest time and I don't like to say 
I gave up on it because it always stayed on the back of my mind for the longest time.
My app idea was a cheats app for the Sims 4 where you can easily bookmark and search all
your favorite cheats in one place. I hated having to look up cheats on the internet, it 
just slowed down my gameplay. Which is why I love mobile development because its convenient 
and there to make the simple things, easier.
