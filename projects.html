                    Most of the assets, like the game map and the krabby patties, I drew using 
                    Adobe Illustrator. I also animated the Squidward sprite in the main menu hardcoding
                    each sprite from the spritesheet. There was probably definitely a better way to do this.

                    Managing and organizing the clicks between a raw patty, a perfect patty, and a burnt patty. 
                    For awhile, it was difficult to get the sprite to change its texture after a 
                    certain amount of time on the grill.

                    I gave up on making this app more than 3 times. I first tried developing it back in 2017, 
                    but I got stuck trying to understand Xcode's UI. Four years later, I successfully
                    developed the app in one week.

                    Passing data backwards in the Career and Skills cheats scenes to the Bookmark 
                    scene. I wanted users to be able to keep their bookmarked cheats; I wanted the 
                    app to remember old data.

                    This was a school assignment for my Intro to Programming class. One of the hardest things
                    I ever made because I was new to game logic.

                    Printing the board. I had a difficult time understanding that you could store the characters
                    for the project inside a 2D array given the correct conditions. Then just print everything once
                    all if statements are passed.
